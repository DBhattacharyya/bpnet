The Bpnet program is a stand alone command line program for Linux.
The program is written in C++ and Fortran.

Once you download the zip or tar.zip file and extract it, 
you will get several folders. 

FOR READY EXECUTABLE:

     1.  go to the bin directory. you will get two executables named
            i)   bpnet.linux
	   ii)   bpnet.linux.parallel
     2.  Copy them to your suitable directory. We prefer

          sudo cp bpnet.linux /usr/local/bin
          sudo cp bpnet.linux.parallel /usr/local/bin

     3. go to sysfiles directory and place all the files inside 
        sysfiles directory to a suitable directory. We prefer,
	   
          sudo cp *.name /usr/local/bin
          sudo cp *.xyz  /usr/local/bin

     4.  set the environment variables. The program needs to know 
         the path where the .name and .xyz files are kept. So, do the following

	  i) Open your .bashrc file.
	
	  ii) append these two lines in .bashrc file
	      
	      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4    (Assuming you have a 4-cpu machine)

	      export  NUCLEIC_ACID_DIR=/usr/local/bin/

	      (Assuming .name and .xyz files of sysfile directory are placed
	       in /usr/local/bin)

     5.  Done.


RUN:
     We have given two sample mmCIF files in the data folder.
     place them in a folder. Go to that folder from terminal
     and supply the following command.

     SERIAL RUN:

             bpnet.linux 1s72.cif      (For base pair network)

	     bplet.linux 1s72.cif -overlap=true   (For overlap network)


     
     PARALLEL RUN:

             bpnet.linux.parallel 1s72.cif      (For base pair network)

	     bplet.linux.parallel 1s72.cif -overlap=true   (For overlap network)



COMPILATION:
     If the given execulatbles do not work for you, we provide the source code.
     The compilation process is as follows.

     SERIAL MODE COMPILATION:
         
         1. Using terminal go to the src directory and do the following usaing terminal. 
         2. Rename the Makefile_serial to Makefile
         3. Enter the following command
                  make clean
         4. Then run the following command
                  make
	 

     PARALLEL MODE COMPILATION:
         1. Using terminal go to the src directory and do the following usaing terminal.
         2. Rename the Makefile_parallel to Makefile
         3. Enter the following command
                  make clean
         4. Then run the following command
                  make
	 

     After compilation, place the executables in to /usr/local/bin. The .name and .xyz files related 
     tasks are same. So also for environment variables. For these follow step 3-5 from "FOR READY EXECUTABLE:" given at the bigining.
